Paper submission is managed through [CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ECMLPKDDworkshop2023) (login and select ECMLPKDDworkshop2023, then click on Create new submission and select _8th Workshop on Advanced Analytics and Learning on Temporal Data (AALTD) at ECML-PKDD 2023_).

**Submissions will be double-blind (anonymised) and reviewed by at least 2 program committee members.**


There are  two submission tracks:
* Oral presentation
* Poster session (including research in progress and demos)


Authors that would not want their papers to apply for possible oral presentation should inform the organisers at the time of submission. Submitted papers should be 6 to 16 pages long using the LNCS formatting style.
 
After the workshop, authors of selected papers will be invited for publication in a special volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series (see [last yearâ€™s edition](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-24378-3)).
