Paper submission is managed through [CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ECMLPKDDworkshop2023) (login and select ECMLPKDDworkshop2023, then click on Create new submission and select _8th Workshop on Advanced Analytics and Learning on Temporal Data (AALTD) at ECML-PKDD 2023_).

**Submissions will be double-blind (anonymised) and reviewed by at least 2 program committee members.**


There are  two submission tracks:
* Oral presentation
* Poster session (including research in progress and demos)


Authors that would not want their papers to apply for possible oral presentation should inform the organisers at the time of submission. Submitted papers should be 6 to 16 pages long using the LNCS formatting style.

Each accepted paper will be invited to propose a camera ready version of their article taking into account the reviewers recommendations. Note that being accepted as a poster does not require reducing the length of the article. The organizers prepare the list of oral presentations, considering the program constraints and the scientific interest for broader exposition of the work.

At least one of the authors must be registered to the conference. If not, the paper will not appear in the program.

All the articles accepted for the workshop will be available online for at least 3 years.
 
After the workshop, authors of selected papers will be invited for publication in a special volume in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series (see [last yearâ€™s edition](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-24378-3)).
