## "Convolutional kernels for effective and scalable time series analytics" by Geoff Webb

### Abstract
Time series classification is a fundamental data science task, interpreting dynamic processes as they evolve over time. Convolutional kernels provide an effective method for extracting a wide range of different forms of information from time series data. I present the Rocket family of time series classification technologies that utilize convolutional kernels to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with many orders of magnitude greater efficiency and scalability than any alternative.  These make time series classification feasible at hitherto unattainable scale.  The methods also have potential application across many other forms of time series analysis, including extrinsic regression, clustering, anomaly detection, segmentation and forecasting.

Professor Geoff Webb is an eminent and highly-cited data scientist. He was editor in chief of the Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery journal, from 2005 to 2014. He has been Program Committee Chair of both ACM SIGKDD and IEEE ICDM, as well as General Chair of ICDM and member of the ACM SIGKDD Executive. He is a Technical Advisor to machine learning as a service startup BigML Inc and to recommender systems startup FROOMLE. He developed many of the key mechanisms of support-confidence association discovery in the 1980s.  His OPUS search algorithm remains the state-of-the-art in rule search. He pioneered multiple research areas as diverse as black-box user modelling, interactive data analytics and statistically-sound pattern discovery.  He has developed many useful machine learning algorithms that are widely deployed.  His many awards include IEEE Fellow, the inaugural Eureka Prize for Excellence in Data Science (2017) and the Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Distinguished Research Contributions Award (2022).
