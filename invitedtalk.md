Geoff Webb is Research Director of the Monash University Data Futures Institute. He is a leading data scientist and the only Australian to have been Program Committee Chair of the two leading Data Mining conferences, ACM SIGKDD and IEEE ICDM. He was elevated to IEEE Fellow in 2015 and his numerous awards include the inaugural Eureka Prize for Excellence in Data Science (2017).

He was editor in chief of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery from 2005 to 2014. He is a Technical Advisor to BigML Inc, who have incorporated his best of class association discovery software, Magnum Opus, as a core component of their cloud-based Machine Learning service. He developed many of the key mechanisms of support-confidence association discovery in the 1980s. His OPUS search algorithm remains the state-of-the-art in rule search. He pioneered multiple research areas as diverse as black-box user modelling, interactive data analytics and statistically-sound pattern discovery. He has developed many useful machine learning algorithms that are widely deployed.
