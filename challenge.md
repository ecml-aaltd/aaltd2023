# Human Activity Segmentation Challenge

This is *Discovery Challenge* will take place during the ECM/PKDD 2023 conference.

## Description

Human activity recognition (HAR) is essential for health monitoring, personal security, and various other applications. Current HAR systems process fixed-length subsequences of sensor data, e.g. 1 second, leading to performance losses for longer complex activities. This challenge focuses on improving accuracy of such systems by exploring the under-studied area of partitioning real-world, multi-variate human motion sensor data into variable-sized activity segments. You will work with a large new data set featuring 10.7 hours of multi-dimensional smartphone sensor data from students performing 100 different daily activities. Your objective is to accurately segment this complex motion data into an unknown number of single activities.

## Timeline

More information on registration, etc coming soon.

**Start of the challenge is 11th april.**
